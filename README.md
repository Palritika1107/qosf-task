# QOSF mentorship Task :Quantum Circuit Simulator

The aim of the task is to implement a simple quantum circuit simulator.

Steps:
1)Initialising Ground State
2)Calculating the matrix operator
3)Multiplying the operator with the state vector to obtain the final state
4)Measuring and obtaining the frequency of occurance of all possible states
